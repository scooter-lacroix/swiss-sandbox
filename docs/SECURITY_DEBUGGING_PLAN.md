# Security and Resource Management Debugging Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines critical security vulnerabilities and resource management issues identified in the sandbox system, along with a systematic approach to resolve them.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Daemon Thread Resource Leaks
**Impact**: High - Uncontrolled thread creation, memory leaks
**Location**: `src/sandbox/mcp_sandbox_server.py:213`, `src/sandbox/mcp_sandbox_server_stdio.py:329`
**Description**: Flask daemon threads created without proper lifecycle management
**Fix**: Implement thread pool management with proper cleanup

### 2. Subprocess Management Issues
**Impact**: High - Zombie processes, resource exhaustion
**Location**: Both MCP servers
**Description**: Subprocess.Popen processes not properly tracked or cleaned up
**Fix**: Process manager with automatic cleanup and timeout handling

### 3. Unlimited Memory Usage
**Impact**: High - System memory exhaustion
**Location**: `src/sandbox/core/execution_context.py`
**Description**: Unbounded growth of execution globals, compilation cache
**Fix**: Implement memory limits and monitoring

### 4. Temporary Directory Proliferation
**Impact**: High - Disk space exhaustion
**Location**: Multiple locations
**Description**: Artifacts directories accumulate without cleanup
**Fix**: Automatic cleanup system with age-based removal

## ðŸŸ¡ High Priority Issues

### 5. Security Command Filtering Bypass
**Impact**: Medium-High - Potential system compromise
**Location**: `shell_execute` function
**Description**: Weak command filtering vulnerable to bypass
**Fix**: Enhanced regex-based filtering with comprehensive patterns

### 6. File System Access Controls
**Impact**: Medium-High - Unauthorized file access
**Location**: Working directory defaults
**Description**: Insufficient access controls and sandboxing
**Fix**: Implement chroot-like restrictions and proper sandboxing

### 7. Network Resource Management
**Impact**: Medium - Port exhaustion, network resource leaks
**Location**: `find_free_port()` and web app launching
**Description**: Unbounded port usage and web server management
**Fix**: Port pool management and web server lifecycle control

## ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority Issues

### 8. Logging and Monitoring Gaps
**Impact**: Medium - Operational visibility
**Description**: Insufficient monitoring of resource usage
**Fix**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system

### 9. Session Management
**Impact**: Medium - Data accumulation
**Description**: Session data grows without cleanup
**Fix**: Session lifecycle management with automatic cleanup

- Network security validation

## Success Criteria

### Security
- [ ] No command injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Proper file system isolation
- [ ] No resource exhaustion vulnerabilities
- [ ] Secure defaults enforced

### Resource Management
- [ ] Memory usage bounded and monitored
- [ ] Process cleanup guaranteed
- [ ] Disk usage controlled
- [ ] Network resources managed

### Operational
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring
- [ ] Automatic error recovery
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Clear operational procedures

## Risk Assessment

### Before Fixes
- **Security Risk**: HIGH - Multiple attack vectors
- **Stability Risk**: HIGH - Resource exhaustion likely
- **Operational Risk**: HIGH - No monitoring/recovery

### After Fixes
- **Security Risk**: LOW - Comprehensive protections
- **Stability Risk**: LOW - Bounded resource usage
- **Operational Risk**: LOW - Full monitoring/recovery

## Timeline
- **Stage 1**: 2-3 hours (Critical fixes)
- **Stage 2**: 1-2 hours (Security hardening)
- **Stage 3**: 1 hour (Monitoring)
- **Stage 4**: 1 hour (Optimization)

**Total Estimated Time**: 5-7 hours

## Post-Implementation
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Team training
- [ ] Monitoring setup
