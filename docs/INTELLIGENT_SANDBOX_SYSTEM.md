# Intelligent Sandbox System

## Overview

The Intelligent Sandbox System transforms the existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) from a basic shell into a comprehensive "virtual computer" environment where AI models can perform ALL coding-related actions safely, including terminal commands of all kinds, without any concern of affecting user files or system negatively.

## Architecture

The system consists of five main components:

1. **Workspace Cloning** - Creates isolated copies of user workspaces
2. **Codebase Analysis** - Understands structure, patterns, and context
3. **Task Planning** - Creates dynamic, detailed task breakdowns  
4. **Execution Engine** - Executes tasks with comprehensive error handling
5. **Action Logging** - Maintains detailed logs of all activities

## Key Features

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```python
# Create workspace session
session = lifecycle_manager.create_workspace(
    source_path="/path/to/project",
    session_id="my-task-session"
)

# Analyze codebase
analysis = analyzer.analyze_codebase(session.workspace)

# Create task plan
task_plan = planner.create_plan("Implement new feature", analysis)

# Execute tasks
execution_result = executor.execute_plan(task_plan)

# Review results
history = logger.get_execution_history(session.session_id)

# Cleanup
lifecycle_manager.destroy_workspace(session.session_id)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Custom isolation config
isolation_config = IsolationConfig(
    use_docker=True,
    network_isolation=True,
    cpu_limit="2.0",
    memory_limit="4g",
    allowed_hosts=["pypi.org", "github.com"]
)

# Custom security policy
security_policy = SecurityPolicy(
    max_cpu_percent=80,
    max_memory_mb=4096,
    max_disk_mb=10240,
    blocked_commands=["rm", "sudo", "su"],
    allowed_domains=["trusted-domain.com"]
)
```
