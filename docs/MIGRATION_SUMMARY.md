# Swiss Sandbox Migration Summary

## Task 7: Migrate and Consolidate Existing Functionality

This document summarizes the successful migration and consolidation of scattered functionality from multiple broken server implementations into the unified Swiss Sandbox server - the Swiss army knife of AI toolkits.

## What Was Migrated

### 1. Manim Execution Capabilities
**Source**: `src/sandbox/mcp_sandbox_server_stdio.py` (execute_manim_code function)
**Migrated to**: `src/sandbox/migration/legacy_functionality.py` (ManimExecutor class)

**Features migrated**:
- Complete Manim script execution with quality settings
- Virtual environment detection and usage
- Animation file generation and tracking
- Proper timeout handling (5 minutes)
- Scene detection from output
- Media directory management
- Error handling and logging

**Integration**: Added `create_manim_animation` and `list_manim_animations` tools to unified server

### 2. Web App Building and Serving
**Source**: `src/sandbox/mcp_sandbox_server_stdio.py` (launch_web_app, export_flask_app, export_streamlit_app functions)
**Migrated to**: `src/sandbox/migration/legacy_functionality.py` (WebAppManager class)

**Features migrated**:
- Flask application launching with automatic port detection
- Streamlit application launching with subprocess management
- Flask app export with Docker containerization
- Streamlit app export with Docker containerization
- Requirements.txt generation
- Docker Compose configuration
- README.md generation with instructions
- Active web server tracking and cleanup

**Integration**: Added `start_web_app` and `export_web_app` tools to unified server

### 3. Artifact Interception and Management
**Source**: `src/sandbox/mcp_sandbox_server_stdio.py` (monkey_patch_matplotlib, monkey_patch_pil, collect_artifacts functions)
**Migrated to**: `src/sandbox/migration/legacy_functionality.py` (ArtifactInterceptor class)

**Features migrated**:
- Matplotlib monkey patching for automatic plot saving
- PIL/Pillow monkey patching for automatic image saving
- Recursive artifact collection from directories
- Base64 encoding for small files
- File categorization by directory structure
- Artifact metadata tracking (size, type, path)

**Integration**: Added `execute_with_artifacts` tool to unified server

### 4. Intelligent Sandbox Features
**Source**: `src/sandbox/intelligent_sandbox_server.py` and `src/sandbox/intelligent/mcp/server.py`
**Migrated to**: `src/sandbox/migration/legacy_functionality.py` (IntelligentSandboxIntegration class)

**Features migrated**:
- Workspace cloning and isolation
- Codebase analysis with language detection
- Task planning capabilities
- Execution engine integration
- Component availability checking
- Dynamic import handling

**Integration**: Added `create_workspace`, `analyze_codebase`, and `destroy_workspace` tools to unified server

## Migration Architecture

### Migration Package Structure
```
src/sandbox/migration/
├── __init__.py                 # Package exports
└── legacy_functionality.py    # Core migration classes
```

### Integration Points
The migrated functionality is integrated into the unified server through:

1. **Component Initialization**: All migrated components are initialized in `UnifiedSandboxServer.__init__()`
2. **Tool Registration**: New MCP tools are registered in `_register_migrated_tools()`
3. **Resource Management**: Cleanup is handled in `_cleanup()` method
4. **Context Integration**: Uses existing execution contexts and artifact management

### Key Classes Migrated

#### ManimExecutor
- Handles Manim script execution
- Manages virtual environment detection
- Provides quality settings and timeout handling
- Generates animations with proper file management

#### WebAppManager
- Launches Flask and Streamlit applications
- Manages port allocation and server tracking
- Exports applications as Docker containers
- Handles cleanup of running web servers

#### ArtifactInterceptor
- Monkey patches matplotlib and PIL for automatic saving
- Collects artifacts recursively from directories
- Provides metadata and content encoding
- Integrates with existing artifact management

#### IntelligentSandboxIntegration
- Bridges to intelligent sandbox components
- Handles workspace creation and analysis
- Provides codebase analysis capabilities
- Manages component availability checking

## Verification Results

The migration was thoroughly tested and verified:

✅ **All migrated functionality successfully integrated**
- Manim execution: ✓ Working (animations created successfully)
- Web app management: ✓ Working (Flask/Streamlit apps launch and export)
- Artifact interception: ✓ Working (matplotlib plots automatically saved)
- Intelligent features: ✓ Working (workspace creation and codebase analysis)

✅ **Component Integration**
- All components properly initialized
- MCP tools registered and accessible
- Resource cleanup implemented
- Error handling preserved

✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to core APIs
- Enhanced capabilities added seamlessly

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Consolidation
- Eliminated multiple fragmented server implementations
- Single authoritative server entry point
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Unified configuration management

### 2. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular architecture with migration package
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper resource cleanup

### 3. Enhanced Functionality
- All scattered features now available in one place
- Improved integration between components
- Better resource management
- Enhanced debugging and monitoring

### 4. Reliability
- Eliminated broken redirects and hanging tools
- Proper timeout handling
- Comprehensive error recovery
- Resource leak prevention

## Requirements Satisfied

This migration satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- **6.1**: Existing MCP configurations continue to work
- **6.2**: Custom scripts compatible with restored system  
- **6.3**: User data and settings preserved during migration
- **6.4**: Clear documentation of migration paths

The migration successfully consolidates all scattered functionality while maintaining backward compatibility and enhancing the overall system reliability and maintainability.
