# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Swiss Sandbox system has been severely corrupted by an incompetent agent, resulting in a fragmented state with multiple broken server implementations, hanging execute tools, overly restrictive security systems, and scattered functionality across different modules. This restoration project aims to consolidate, repair, and unify the Swiss Sandbox into a single, functional, and reliable MCP server system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Architecture Unification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, unified Swiss Sandbox MCP server, so that I don't have to deal with multiple conflicting server implementations and broken redirects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is restored THEN there SHALL be only one primary MCP server entry point
2. WHEN a user runs the server THEN it SHALL start without import errors or broken redirects
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL consolidate all functionality from scattered modules into a cohesive system
4. IF multiple server files exist THEN the system SHALL have a clear hierarchy with one authoritative implementation

### Requirement 2: Execute Tool Functionality Restoration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the execute tools to work reliably without hanging, so that I can run commands and code in the sandbox environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the execute tool THEN it SHALL complete operations without hanging indefinitely
2. WHEN I run safe commands THEN the security system SHALL allow them to execute
3. WHEN I execute code THEN it SHALL provide proper output, error handling, and timeout management
4. IF an execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 3: Security System Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the security system to be protective but not overly restrictive, so that I can run legitimate commands while maintaining safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run safe, common commands THEN the security system SHALL allow them without unnecessary restrictions
2. WHEN I attempt dangerous operations THEN the security system SHALL block them with clear explanations
3. WHEN the security system blocks a command THEN it SHALL suggest safe alternatives when possible
4. IF security rules are too restrictive THEN they SHALL be revised to balance safety with usability

### Requirement 4: MCP Server Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Swiss Sandbox to work seamlessly as an MCP server, so that I can integrate it with MCP-compatible tools and IDEs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL properly implement the MCP protocol
2. WHEN tools connect to the server THEN they SHALL receive proper tool definitions and capabilities
3. WHEN tools invoke server functions THEN they SHALL receive properly formatted responses
4. IF the MCP connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 5: Code Organization and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the codebase to be well-organized and maintainable, so that future modifications don't break the system again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code THEN it SHALL have clear module separation and responsibilities
2. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL have proper error handling and logging
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive diagnostic information
4. IF modules need to be updated THEN they SHALL have clear interfaces and documentation

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current configurations and workflows to continue working, so that I don't lose productivity during the restoration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is restored THEN existing MCP configurations SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN users have custom scripts THEN they SHALL be compatible with the restored system
3. WHEN migrating from broken state THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and settings
4. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration paths

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance person, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the restored system works correctly, so that we don't introduce new bugs or regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restoration is complete THEN all core functionality SHALL be tested and verified
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL pass without errors
3. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
4. IF tests fail THEN the issues SHALL be identified and resolved before deployment

### Requirement 8: Artifact System Restoration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the artifact system to work correctly, so that I can manage and access generated files, outputs, and resources properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN artifacts are generated THEN they SHALL be properly stored and accessible
2. WHEN I request artifacts THEN the system SHALL provide them without corruption or errors
3. WHEN artifacts are modified THEN the changes SHALL be tracked and managed correctly
4. IF artifacts were altered by the broken agent THEN they SHALL be restored or regenerated

### Requirement 9: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Swiss Sandbox to be fast and reliable, so that I can depend on it for my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing commands THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN the server runs THEN it SHALL be stable and not crash under normal usage
3. WHEN handling multiple requests THEN the system SHALL maintain performance
4. IF performance issues occur THEN they SHALL be identified and optimized
